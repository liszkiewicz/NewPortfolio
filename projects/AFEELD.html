These compositions take as their subject the creative, playful role of the individual in conceptualizing and defining space. The collection was published in 2017 by the <a href="https://www.cddc.vt.edu/">Collaboratory for Digital Discourse and Culture at Virginia Tech</a>, as part of their peer-reviewed ‘Digital Originals’ book series.

            The 143 visual poems in this Flickr album were all created by people 'reading' and using the interactive poems in the original version of <i>Count as One</i>. The new HTML5 version publishes not to this album, but directly to the 'afeeld' Flickr photostream, alongside output produced by 'M!ndsweeper'.

        <p class="marginsInterior">For detailed descriptions of <i>AFEELD</i>'s six chapters, I would recommend <a href="http://iloveepoetry.org/?p=354">E-Lit scholar Leonardo Flores' review of the collection</a>. The book's <a href="https://elmcip.net/creative-work/afeeld">ELMCIP entry</a> also contains information about its exhibition and publication history (which appears at the bottom of this page.)

            “The most interesting aspect about this work is the insight it provides on the psychogeography of the screen, shaping our interaction as a kind of dérive. Do several (or all) the pieces and think about how the graphical information he provides on each piece shapes where you click on the screen.” -- <a href="http://iloveepoetry.org/?p=354">Leonardo Flores</a>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            "‘Count As One’ [from <i>AFEELD</i>] is a really clever mix of visual poetry and DIY interactivity – allowing the reader/participant to help in the creation of the poem, but also offering the chance to print or publish the poem directly to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afeeld/">Liszkiewicz’s Flickr account</a>... This is something I haven’t seen before, and a very interesting way to overcome the in-built obsolescence familiar to most interactive digital writing." -- <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100201070241/http://www.chrisjoseph.org/blog/reviews/count-as-one-by-liszkiewiczmiller-in-the-new-river-journal">Chris Joseph</a>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            "Clean, provocative, and almost sculptural, Liszkiewicz plays with a very plastic conception of language. A must for those interested in the visual use of the letter." -- <a href="https://scorecard.typepad.com/crag_hills_poetry_score/2010/06/slack-buddha-is-happy-to-announce-this-seasons-new-la-perruque-chapbooks-mohammad-moriarty-apps-lisz.html">Crag Hill</a>
