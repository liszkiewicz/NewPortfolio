        <p class="marginsInterior"><span class="highlight" style="font-weight: 700;">Courageous Cannonball Commander</span> was the first 'person-shooter' for the original Oculus Rift Development Kits (i.e. DK1 and DK2). It was a VR-based ballistic physics platformer, and a kind of nausea-inducing flight simulator, inspired by the 'toss' genre of browser-based games (e.g. 'Toss the Turtle', 'Kitten Cannon', and 'Burrito Bison Revenge').

        <!--Project Description: Meaning and Context-->
        <p class="marginsInterior">Users play as an office worker who is pretending to work, but who is actually browsing the website 'Faceboom', where they find a browser-based game called <i>Courageous Cannonball Commander</i>. The user launches the Faceboom game and is transported inside the CRT monitor of their desktop computer, where <span class="highlight">they assume the role of a human cannonball and are shot out of a cannon.</span> They swim though the air, and use items to try and land on trampolines and other special surfaces, in an effort to perpetuate their flight as long as possible. The landings can get a litte rough!

                        The user's computer serves as the game's main menu, which invites the user to ignore their boring work and play <i>Courageous Cannonball Commander</i> in their browser.

                        The player has been launched through the air, inside the CRT monitor on their desk, and tries to aim for targets and trampolines that might lengthen their flight, and increase their score.

                        <i>Courageous Cannonball Commander</i> was exhibited at InterActive Demo Day at Rensselear Polytechnic Institute in Spring 2014. Here we see Marc Destefano, one of the game's developers, demoing the game outside the EMPAC building at RPI.

       <!--Project Description: What you did, and the state of the project-->
        <p class="marginsInterior"><span class="highlight">I was the lead writer and narrative designer for the project,</span> and also contributed as a level designer. The project was developed in three weeks for the Oculus IndieCade Game Jam, and was released in Fall 2013. Sadly, <i>Courageous Cannonball Commander</i> is now extremely difficult to run, for a variety of technical and practical reasons -- but its spirit lives on in the <i>H3VR</i> game mode <i>Meat Fortress</i>, where users can fire rockets at their feet and launch themselves into the air. (See the video in the tweet below, where fellow RUST LTD. developer Anton Hand 'rocket jumps' across the <i>Meat Fortress</i> level.)
