The app used a draft process inspired by ‘five-card draw’ poker, allowing for a unique, fast, and tactical drafting experience. Players scored points using standard fantasy football rules and competed in short timed rounds at Dave & Buster’s.

        <!--Project Description: Meaning and Context-->
        <p class="marginsInterior"><span class="highlight">As the project’s lead designer,</span> I conceptualized and designed the core gameplay, wrote the game design document, and managed a five-person design team as we created, playtested, and iterated the game’s prototype. I then helped direct a third-party development team as they brought the prototype to Alpha, Beta, and Gold Master. The game was published and released during the 2015-16 NFL Season, and played at Dave & Buster’s locations nationwide until the 2015-16 season ended.
