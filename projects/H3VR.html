        <!--Project Description: Meaning and Context-->
        <p class="marginsInterior"><span class="highlight"><i>H3VR</i> is a darkly comedic satire of a game genre that treats people like meat.</span> While the simulation behind <i>H3VR</i>'s firearms is hyper-realistic, the game excludes 'realistic' representations of human violence. Instead, players battle anthropomorphic sausages (a.k.a. 'Sosigs') across over 20 levels, including parodies of <i>Westworld</i>, <i>The Walking Dead</i>, <i>Team Fortress 2</i>, and <i>Saw</i>.
