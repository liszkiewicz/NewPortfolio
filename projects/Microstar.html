        <p class="marginsInterior"><span class="highlight" style="font-weight: 700;">Museum of the Microstar</span> is a dark comedy narrative game and technology demonstration that became one of the first VR experiences on the original Oculus Rift Development Kit. It was originally developed in five weeks for <a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2013/02/01/directx-11-competition/">the Unity DirectX11 Competition</a>, and was awarded the grand prize in February 2013.

        <!--Project Description: Meaning and Context-->
        <p class="marginsInterior">The game takes place in the distant future in an underground museum built by Hedron, the last corporation in the known universe. This corporate museum chronicles (and celebrates) an historical-fictional progression of human energy technologies, which ultimately destroyed the planet Earth and all life on its surface. In this way, <span class="highlight">the game is not just a cautionary tale of ecological disaster; it is also a tech demo that satirizes tech demos.</span>

                        The level design of <i>Microstar</i> undergirds a narrative progression from contemporary to futuristic and fantastical energy sources. As users move from one station to the next, the exhibits become increasingly futuristic, and the writing becomes more satirical and absurdly comedic.

                        <<</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a onClick="slide(1)">>></a></nav>
                        Early in the experience, users encounter the 'Coal' exhibit, and learn about an energy source that was once very common but which no longer exists (in the game's narrative universe).

                        Next, users might encounter the 'Petroleum' exhibit, and learn about primitive technological creatures called 'automobiles', and a city called 'Lost Angelese' where people lived inside of these creatures.

                        The user might then encounter the 'Uranium' exhibit -- and as more powerful energy sources are displayed, the user hears more and more extreme stories of sociopolitical conflict and environmental degredation.

                        Exhibits become increasingly fantastical, and the stories become absurdly hyperbolic, as the user approaches exhibits like this one, which houses Hedron's patented Uberfungus.

                        The entire museum was built around its final exhibit, the first stable Microstar in the known universe. It was this technology that allowed humankind to begin exploring outside its solar system -- and the energy source that finally destroyed the planet Earth.

                        The game level was designed to slowly and subtly bring users both up and toward the centrally-located Microstar. In this way, the architecture of the space is designed to reinforce the game's narrative: an historical progression through increasingly powerful and dangeous energy sources, which culminated in the destruction of Earth via the creation of a Microstar.

                        Ultimately, we hoped that <i>Microstar</i> would give VR users the chance to slowly and carefully consider the future of virtual reality--and of new technologies in general--in relation to the dominant narratives around technological progress in contemporary culture. And we hoped they'd laugh, too.

       <!--Project Description: What you did, and the state of the project-->
        <p class="marginsInterior">After winning the competition, we ported <i>Museum of the Microstar</i> to the original Oculus Rift "Development Kit 1" (DK1), and it was the third published game to function on the groundbreaking VR device. In an ironic twist, Oculus frequently used <i>Microstar</i> when <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/behind-the-scenes-at-gdc-and-new-oculus-ready-demos/?locale=en_US">giving public demonstrations</a> of their original Rift headset. The project has been exhibited in conferences and galleries around the world. <span class="highlight">I was the narrative designer and lead writer on the project,</span> and also contributed as a level designer and worldbuilder.

In the first video, two people affiliated with the Center for Art and Media (ZKM) explore the level, and discuss and contextualize the project. In the second video, a YouTube reviewer conducts a long form walkthrough of the VR experience, talks about what he sees, and listens to most of the game's narrative content.
